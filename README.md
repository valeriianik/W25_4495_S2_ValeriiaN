Originally developed by Valeriia Nikitina and Valeriya Saltykova, NativeSpark Integration Solutions Corp. emerged from their unique expertise and shared vision. Although the platform was initially a collaborative effort, Valeriia Nikitina will now continue to develop the idea and platform independently.
This transition marks a new chapter for NativeSpark, as Valeriia takes the lead in refining the platform's features, expanding its capabilities, and advancing its mission. By leveraging her background in data analysis and her commitment to empowering Indigenous communities, Valeriia aims to ensure that NativeSpark evolves into a robust, scalable solution that meets the current needs of its users while adapting to future challenges.
The project will maintain its original vision of fostering Indigenous entrepreneurship, with a strong focus on enhancing user experience, integrating advanced technologies, and exploring growth opportunities in the United States market. Valeriia is dedicated to preserving the collaborative spirit of the initiative while elevating the platform to new heights.
